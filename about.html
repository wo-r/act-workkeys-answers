                    Firstly, this requires the <b>Inspect Tool</b> common in most browsers by using CTRL + I (CMD + OPTION + I, for mac). Then you must go to the <b>Network</b> tab seen at the top:
                </p>
                <img src="./res/img/img-1.png" class="w-fit">
                <p>
                    Once you get there, and are on <b>workkeyscurriculum.act.org</b>, you then should go to the <b>filter</b> search bar:
                </p>
                <img src="./res/img/img-2.png" class="w-fit">
                <p>
                    Look for files named <b>web.json</b>. These relate to your personal account, so they will vary, however they all still should be the same in most ways.
                </p>
                <img src="./res/img/img-3.png" class="w-fit">
                <p>
                    Click on each of them and make sure you are on the <b>Resource</b> tab on the right side when you click it. Once you start doing that, look for a one that resembles this:

                    Once you this file, simply CTRL + F (CMD + F, for mac) and search for the question you are looking for. <b>IT MUST BE THE ANSWER QUESITON, NOT THE ACTUAL QUESTION</b>, here shown below in green is what I mean:
                </p>
                <img src="./res/img/img-4.jpg" class="w-fit">
                <p>
                    Once you have found your question, look for the <b>"correct_answer"</b> json variable. This is <b>encoded in Base64</b>, you can easily decrypt it <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/" class="underline">here</a>:
                </p>
                <pre class="text-[10px]"><code>
Here is an example:
    
    Qw== <-- BASE64 
    
Converted: C <-- UTF-8, in readable string
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    And thats it! You can now easily get the answers yourself, however I'd recommend my website, since I went through the effort to get them all, and make them really fancy for you to easily understand and find each questiona and there answer. However, <b>I do not know if they change there questions every year</b>, hence why I listed this as 2025. But in the end, you know what to do now, so it's not really a big loss. Enjoy!
